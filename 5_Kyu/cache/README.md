If you are calculating complex things or execute time-consuming API calls, you sometimes want to cache the results. In this case we want you to create a function wrapper, which takes a function and caches its results depending on the arguments, that were applied to the function.

Usage example:

```javascript
var complexFunction = function (arg1, arg2) {
    /* complex calculation in here */
};
var cachedFunction = cache(complexFunction);

cachedFunction('foo', 'bar'); // complex function should be executed
cachedFunction('foo', 'bar'); // complex function should not be invoked again, instead the cached result should be returned
cachedFunction('foo', 'baz'); // should be executed, because the method wasn't invoked before with these arguments
```
