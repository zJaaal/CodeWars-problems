No time for stories. Reverse an array, return the result. Do whatever you want with the original array. Don't use `Array.prototype.reverse`.

```if:javascript
You have 30 bytes to spare.
```

```if:typescript
You have 47 bytes to spare.
```

Example: `[1, 2, 3]` → `[3, 2, 1]`

And this time you won't be able to do _the thing_ from [that kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reverse-it-quickly).

```if:javascript
`require` isn't allowed as well.
```

```if:typescript
`require`, `import` and `from` are't allowed as well.
```
